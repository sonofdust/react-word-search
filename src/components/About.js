          With our application, you can select the size of the puzzle grid,
          choose the level of difficulty, and even customize the color scheme
          and background image to make your puzzle truly unique. Once you submit
          your choices, our application will generate a printable puzzle with
          the words hidden in the grid, ready for you to solve.

          with others via a unique URL. This makes it easy to share your puzzles
          with friends and family, or use them for educational purposes.
